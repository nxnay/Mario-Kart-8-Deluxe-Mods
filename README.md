### I am NOT to be held responsible for any bans you may have once using these.

### Some mods may not work if they are W-I-P or in Alpha stage.

### All of these are ALL only tested in YUZU, expect bugs or errors upon real hardware and/or Ryujinx.


### How to use
Some of these mods may function differently than others..
feel free to scroll down to which file you are trying to use.


### .bin Files
in order to use .bin files for YUZU, it must be placed in the right directory.
place the mod folder into the right directory

Directory Example;
***yuzu\load\0100152000022000\ModNameHereFolder\romfs\Common\Mush\binFileHere***

Now launch the game, and you will see changes.


### Common Mod Files
If you are unfamiliar with how regular mod files work, then it is simple.
Once you have downloaded the mod you are searching for.. go to your Yuzu load directory, simply by right-clicking on your game inside of YUZU and clicking on 'Mod Data Location.'
Place the mod folder into the directory and launch the game. You are done.


### IPS, pchtxt, etc Files
Same thing with Common Mod Files.


### Custom Driver Mod Tutorial
You must pack your mod into a folder properly.
1. Make a new folder, name it anything of your desire.
2. Make a new folder inside of your folder, name it *"romfs"*
3. Make a new folder inside of your *romfs* folder, name it *"Driver"*
4. Place your .szs file inside of the *Driver* folder, you are done.
5. Place the folder you named into your *Mod Data Location.*

**you are done.**
